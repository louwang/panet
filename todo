快趴網 - quick parse

超簡單parsing

不用會regexp

不用寫程式

今天我想要search特定特徵的 string, 但是又不會寫 regexp, 怎麼辦?

regexp 翻譯器誕生

人類描述語言 => intexp (intuitive expression) => regexp


features:
o. think straight forward
o. basic level of fool-proofing
o. don't need to escape : 避開特殊字元
o. don't need to remember special symbol (like \d \w \W)

(ex. you can just type some examples of the pattern that you want to match 
and the interpreter will try to figure it out)

motivation:
i want to satisfy 
1. the man who want to express the pattern straight forward
2. the man who want to type as few word as possible to express their pattern

definition:
symbol, char, digit, spcae
operator : + * '' or and not

other thoughts:
string is like --------------------------------------------------- contains white space
a limited length of array contains any kind of symbol

my first commit haha
